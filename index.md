# 1701QCA Making Interaction - Assessment 2 workbook

You will use this workbook to keep track of your progress through the course and also as a process journal to document the making of your projects. The comments in italics throughout the template give suggestions about what to include. Feel free to delete those instructions when you have completed the sections.

When you have completed the template, submit the link to the GitHub Pages site for this repository as a link in Learning@Griffith. The link should be something like [https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/](https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/) where `qcainteractivemedia` is replaced with your GitHub username and `1701QCA-Assessment2` is replaced with whatever you called the repository this template is contained in when you set it up.

## Project working title ##
*Insert a name for the project as you conceive of it at the moment.*

## Related projects ##
*Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the appropriate folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing.*

### Related project 1 ###

This project is related to mine because *insert reasons here*.

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence.*

### Design concept 1 ###
Originally I wanted to develop a sport field/facility that will allow different types of sports to be played within a confined space. The field can be made by a shoebox or an object with similar dimensions. 

The first idea was to have a sport field that can hold 2 sports: international football and basketball, but they can't be played concurrently - as only one net at one end to score.

The second idea was to have the same 2 sports but with a divider net/wall in between, have multiple Micro:bit to keep score, and can play concurrently.

The third idea was to have more than 2 sports, but on a bigger scale, similar to the size of a coffee table or something to the extent.

### Design concept 2 ###
I switched my original idea to contribute efforts in the current Covid-19 Pandemic, by potentially encouraging people to stay indoors. This will be done through increasing people's attention span and determination, as people will attempt to not touch aluminum coil whilst crossing it throughout different levels and challenges. The project will be call Don't Touch The Wire.

### Final design concept ###
The second design concept gave me the overall concept for my project: hand-eye coordination. Using the materials and concept from my second concept, I am able to create a family-friendly game where people will try to grab a prize without touching the surrounding to avoid loosing and setting the buzzer on.

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
