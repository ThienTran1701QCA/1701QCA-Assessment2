Same concept but different method and rules as my third design concept. The concept only allows the player to pick up the prize that is surrounded by obstacles using only a picker, whereas, the related project allows the player to use a knitted glove to pick up the maximum amount of prizes per turn.

## Other research ##

The chosen project focuses largely on the concept of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordiation is vastly important in daily life, where simple tasks can be seen as impossible without/with low hand-eye coordination. The coordiation, therefore, can be defined as "the use of eyes to direct muscles towards a task", where it can be used to control small and large movements (study.com). 

https://ilslearningcorner.com/2016-02-hand-eye-coordination-how-hand-eye-coordination-helps-early-readers/
To help me to understand why hand-eye coordination is important, Integrated Learning Strategies simply views the concept as important elements in a person's "proprioception, vestibular, visual processing and sensory-motor. If the person struggles with hand-eye coordination, you may find they have a hard time with balance and coordination, focusing their eyes on their hand movements, poor handwriting, playing sports, and trouble griping their pencil." This means that hand-eye coordination is a life skills that most people must have in great amount, however, one should be entitled to improve on the important life skils while living in the quick paced lifestyle in today's world.

The following project provided an insight of how I envisioned my third design concept. The methods and concept are similar, in which I can turn my third concept into reality by understanding the operations and order in this project. In addition, this project is a prime example of a Micro:bit project in action with relations to the hand-eye coordination concept.

### *Brief resource name/description* ###
In terms of the overall project, I was inspired by the disastrous impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic and the heroic individuals that are working effortlessly everyday to stop the pandemic. One project that comes to mind is the Australian Government's Coronavirus Australia mobile phone app. The app encourages Australians to stay positive and healthy admist the pandemic through different ways: providing health advice, get instant access to the current situation in Australia, check symptoms, find relevant infromation, and etc. The app is available on both the App Store and the Google Play Store, and is suitable for IOS and Android. 
The app is unrelated to my project, but it made me to realise that I can create a simple game that encourages people to stay indoors, to collectively challenge and play the game with people in their household, and to potentially have something to keep their mind busy through improving their hand-eye coordination.

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
Hunt the prize using hand-eye coordiation whilst avoiding the obstacle. 

### Design concept 1 ###
Originally I wanted to develop a sport field/facility that will allow different types of sports to be played within a confined space. The field can be made by a shoebox or an object with similar dimensions. 

The first idea was to have a sport field that can hold 2 sports: international football and basketball, but they can't be played concurrently - as only one net at one end to score. The second idea was to have the same 2 sports but with a divider net/wall in between, have multiple Micro:bit to keep score, and can play concurrently.

The third idea was to have more than 2 sports, but on a bigger scale, similar to the size of a coffee table or something to the extent.

### Design concept 2 ###
I switched my original idea to contribute efforts in the current Covid-19 Pandemic, by potentially encouraging people to stay indoors. This will be done through increasing people's attention span and determination, as people will attempt to not touch aluminum coil whilst crossing it throughout different levels and challenges. The project will be call Don't Touch The Wire. 

![Image](IMG_0380.jpg)

### Final design concept ###
The second design concept gave me the overall concept for my project: hand-eye coordination. Using the materials and concept from my second concept, I am able to create a family-friendly game where people will try to grab a prize without touching the surrounding to avoid loosing and triggering the alarm on.

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

![Image](IMG_0389.jpeg)

The image represents the earlier developments that I made in my second design concept, which ended up helping me to understand how certain materials interact with one another, and more importantly how I can utilise the materials to my advantage. For example, I can use the same aluminum material to design different challenges throughout the game. 

The following image relates to how the second design concept systematically run via coding.

After experimenting with the second design concept, I created my third concept using the knowledge I gained and the avaialble materials that I have at my disposal. Following the interaction flowchart and the overall design itself, I generated the concept and it is represented as follow:

![Image](IMG_0393.jpeg)

However, I felt like I needed to do further experiment with certain materials from my third design concept, in order to finalise my chosen design for the assessment. During the experiment, I realised that a cardbox might provide a stable platform for my project but it wouldn't give me the flexibility I needed, in which I switched to a styrofoam material as my project's platform. The following image provides the different layers for my project at this experimental stage: 

![Image](IMG_0399.jpeg)

The next experimental stages were centered around constructing the basic mechanics of the project. This will contribute largely to my understanding of how the materials work together, and allow me to finish the experimental stage by building the project. 

![Image](IMG_0394.jpeg)

The image shows the different circles that are engraved by the aluminum foil into the styrofoam, which acts as the "pocket" holder for the prizes. It is imperative to take note that the circles are replicas of the actual "pocket" holders for the assessment, as this is currently an experimental one. 

![Image](IMG_0395.jpeg)

In order to complete the "pocket" holders for the prizes, the paper as shown in the image therefore acts as a cover for the "pocket" holder and a divider of the aluminum foil.

The following code demonstrates the current coding for this assessment. Since there are only two results when a person plays the game - which is either to lose and having to restart or wins the game, the code is therefore set up in this order. The first image represents the second result - which is that they either have won the game or is still playing, hence the tick.

![Image](IMG_0396.jpeg)

Whereas, the next image depicts when the player loses by touching the aluminum foil using the clipper, and therefore has to restart the game. 

![Image](IMG_0397.jpeg)

It is important to remember that the previous few images demonstrate the experimental stage of this project, in which the following images demonstrates the refinement and subsequent developement for the final submission of this assessment. 

As I transition from the experimental stage to building the project, I made several implementations that are as follow:

The different angles of my project after being filled by the prizes, where the obstacles surrounding makes it complicated for the players to obtain the prizes. 

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

![Image](bb19c2522081dad7f682c10d99a07903.jpg)

I am going to utilise the Double Diamond design methodology, as they perfectly capture the design process that I went through during this assessment. I wanted to create a project that can either contribute to the local community by maximsing public spaces or to devote my efforts into the Covid-19 pandemic. These two directions helped me to begin with the discover and define stages, where I discovered the topics that I am interested in and defined the different projects that I could explore.

After creating a prototype for a rendition of my second design concept, I realised that I want to contribute some efforts to alleviate the situation of the padenmic and create a game that will keep the same concept as my second design concept. 
Arguably, my third concept came from the developmental phase of the Double Diamond methodolgy, where I creatively design a project based off the hand-eye coordination focal concept. I realised that my second concept design can easily be replicated and has been achieved by numerous Mirco:bit projects, and in order to deliver a successful outcome for this assessment, I would have to design an interesting design that shows an in-depth level of technical development and physical fabrication.

Revolving around the task's underlying requirements and my own criteria, I created a prototype for my final concept, using the same materials and knowledge as my second design concept. In which, the prototype ultimately became my project for this assessment.  


## Next steps ##
Set a limit timer in the code, allowing the player to only have limited time to pick up the prizes.
